My [NixOS](https://nixos.org) config, holding configuration files for both my main desktop (titania) and my laptop (umbriel) in one place.

Created with [nixos-unified-template](https://github.com/juspay/nixos-unified-template)

Because this uses sops for secret management, some elements might not work for you out of the box. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to open an issue, PR, or just send me a message.

Planned (eventually):
- [ ] make [shyfox](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox) profile
- [ ] Add further configuration options
- [ ] Improve configuration useability (and split up the host `configuration.nix`'s a bit better)
